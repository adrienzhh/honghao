The vision for this work is to make robot arm paint like [Sandro Botticelli](https://www.sandrobotticelli.net/). Well, the goal is not quite there yet, but we managed to draw some simple geometric shapes. This was accomplished through probabilistic roadmap search applied to inverse kinematic solutions. I was in charged of defining painting strokes in code as well as 3D print a brush socket for end effector to ensure stable drawing. Be sure to check out the video below,
